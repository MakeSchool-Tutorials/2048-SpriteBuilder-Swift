title: Getting Started with 2048!
slug: getting-started

In this tutorial we will build Make2048 -- a clone of the popular mobile game [2048](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805?mt=8). The gameplay itself is simple but coding the game comes with some puzzles and challenges. You will learn a lot in the next couple of hours! We will use Apple's new Swift programming language together with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D.

<!-- If you aren't familiar with SpriteBuilder you should read our [SpriteBuilder beginner tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder-and-swift/installing-spritebuilder) first since this tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic SpriteBuilder tasks. Make sure you have both SpriteBuilder and Xcode installed! -->

#What you will learn

Throughout this tutorial you will learn many concepts including how to:

- Think critically about game logic
- Prototype a puzzle game without any assets
- Chain CCActions together to animate from code

#The finished product

The final game will look like this:
